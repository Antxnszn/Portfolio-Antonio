        Currently, I'm diving into web development, learning to create dynamic and responsive web applications using tools like CSS, HTML5, Node.js, JavaScript, and React. Also, as a member of my school's Algorithmics Club, I am continuously improving my algorithmic skills in preparation for the ICPC, the most prestigious competitive programming event.
